## What is synthwaves.fm?

synthwaves.fm is a self-hosted streaming server built with Rails 8. Upload your music and video library, organize it by artist, album, and genre, and stream it from any device. It supports internet radio via the Radio Browser API, YouTube playlist imports, smart playlists, downloads, lyrics, and four switchable themes. It implements the Subsonic API so you can use your favorite dedicated music apps. The entire stack runs on SQLite — no Postgres, Redis, or external services required. It installs as a Progressive Web App for a native feel on any platform.

## Getting Started

**Requirements:** Ruby 4.0.1+, SQLite3, ffmpeg

**Optional:** yt-dlp (for YouTube downloads)

**Setup and run:**

```
bin/setup
```

This installs dependencies, prepares the database, and starts the server.

For subsequent launches:

```
bin/dev
```

**Default login:** admin@example.com / abc123

## Configuration

The app runs out of the box with no configuration for local development. For production and self-hosting, you'll want to configure storage and optionally enable YouTube features.

### S3-Compatible Storage (production)

Production deployments need an S3-compatible bucket for audio files, cover art, and video storage. In development, files are stored on local disk — no S3 needed.

Run `bin/rails credentials:edit` and add your bucket credentials:

```yaml
linode:
  access_key_id: xxx
  secret_access_key: xxx
  region: us-east-1
  bucket: your-bucket
  endpoint: https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com
```

This works with any S3-compatible provider (Linode, AWS, MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces, etc.). For AWS S3 specifically, see the commented-out `amazon` service in [`config/storage.yml`](config/storage.yml).

### YouTube API Key

To search YouTube directly from the app, each user adds their own YouTube Data API v3 key in their profile settings. Without a key, users can still paste YouTube URLs directly.

Get a key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) under APIs & Services, then enable the YouTube Data API v3.

### Rails Credentials

Manage with `bin/rails credentials:edit`:

| Credential | Purpose | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `linode.*` | S3 storage for uploads | Yes, for production |
| `groovy.*` | Remote upload rake tasks | Only for rake tasks |
| `secret_key_base` | JWT signing, sessions | Auto-generated |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` | Decrypt credentials in production | — |
| `MUSIC_PATH` | Source directory for `library:push` | `~/Music` |
| `VIDEO_PATH` | Source directory for `videos:push` | `~/Movies` |
| `PORT` | Server port | 3000 |
| `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA` | Run job queue in-process | — |
| `WEB_CONCURRENCY` | Puma worker processes | auto |
| `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` | Puma threads per worker | 3 |
| `JOB_CONCURRENCY` | Solid Queue workers | 2 |

## Uploading Your Library

### Push Music

Upload a directory of audio files. Uses Rails credentials (`groovy.*`) for authentication:

```
MUSIC_PATH=/path/to/music bundle exec rake library:push
```

`MUSIC_PATH` defaults to `~/Music`. Supported formats: mp3, flac, ogg, m4a, aac, wav, wma, opus, webm. Metadata and cover art are extracted automatically. Duplicate tracks are skipped.

### Push Playlists

Upload playlists from cliamp's TOML playlist files. Uses environment variables for authentication:

```
GROOVY_REMOTE_URL=https://groovy.example.com \
GROOVY_CLIENT_ID=bc_xxxx \
GROOVY_SECRET_KEY=xxxx \
bundle exec rake playlists:push
```

Tracks are matched against your existing library by title, artist, and album.

### Push Videos

Upload a directory of video files. Uses Rails credentials (`groovy.*`) for authentication:

```
VIDEO_PATH=/path/to/videos bundle exec rake videos:push
```

`VIDEO_PATH` defaults to `~/Movies`. Supported formats: mp4, mkv, avi, mov, m4v, wmv, flv, webm, ts. Videos are automatically converted to H264/AAC/MP4.

You can also upload tracks and videos through the web UI.

## APIs & Client Apps

| API | Auth | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| JWT REST API | `client_id` + `secret_key` | Building custom integrations |
| Import API | JWT bearer token | Bulk uploading via rake tasks |
| Subsonic API | Username + token/password | Connecting dedicated music apps |

Full documentation is in [`docs/api/`](docs/api/).

### Subsonic-Compatible Apps

synthwaves.fm implements the Subsonic API, so you can connect dedicated music apps and stream your library from any platform. Compatible apps include DSub, play:Sub, Submariner, Clementine, Symfonium, and many more.

## Deployment

### Docker

ffmpeg and yt-dlp are included in the Docker image.

```bash
docker build -t synthwaves_fm .
docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  -e RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<your-master-key> \
  -v synthwaves_fm_storage:/rails/storage \
  --name synthwaves_fm \
  synthwaves_fm
```

### Kamal

A [`config/deploy.yml`](config/deploy.yml) is included for deployment with [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/).

## Development

`bin/dev` starts three processes: the Rails server, the Tailwind CSS watcher, and the Solid Queue worker.

```bash
bin/rspec              # Run test suite
bundle exec rubocop    # Lint Ruby code
bundle exec brakeman   # Security scan
```

Admin panel at `/admin`. Job dashboard at `/jobs`.
